    <h1>Sweet Chili Popcorn Chicken</h1>
    <img src="../img/sweetchilipopcornchicken.webp" alt="sweetchilipopcornchicken">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Take it from our Test Kitchen: Sweet Chili Popcorn Chicken is, quite literally, a “party in your mouth.” Each
        bite is coated in a toasted coconut-panko breading that’s irresistibly crunchy and slightly sweet, perfectly
        balanced by a sticky-sweet chili glaze. And the kicker? They’re baked—not fried—but you’d never guess it from
        the delicious texture.</p>
    <p>Sticky, crispy, tender, and downright addictive, this dish is one you’ll be reaching for again and again. As
        recipe taster Liz Mervosh shared, “Dang, I could eat 15 of these.”</p>

        <li>1 cup panko (Japanese-style breadcrumbs)</li>
        <li>1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons canola oil, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cornstarch</li>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Sweet Chili Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup sweet chili sauce (such Mae Ploy®)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lower-sodium soy sauce or tamari</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lime juice (from 1 lime)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Additional Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>thinly sliced scallions</li>
        <li>toasted sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Prepare the Chicken: Place panko and coconut on a large rimmed baking sheet and toss with 2 tablespoons oil
            to fully coat mixture. Spread into an even layer.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until lightly golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a shallow dish and stir in
            cornstarch. Line the rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Stir together mayonnaise, sweet chili sauce, ginger, garlic powder, salt, and onion powder in a medium bowl.
            Add chicken pieces and toss to coat.</li>
        <li>In batches, toss chicken pieces in panko mixture, pressing to adhere and completely cover each piece;
            transfer coated pieces to prepared baking sheet. Drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Let sit 5 minutes
            to allow breading to set.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of chicken pieces registers
            165 degrees F (74 degrees C) and the coating is golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes, flipping halfway through.
            Let sit 4 minutes before brushing with Sweet Chili Sauce.</li>
        <li>While chicken sits, prepare the Sweet Chili Sauce: Stir together sweet chili sauce, ketchup, soy sauce, and
            lime juice in a small bowl. Brush chicken liberally with sauce.</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken to a bowl and sprinkle with scallions and sesame seeds. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Air-Fry Instructions</h3>
    <p>Preheat air fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 3 minutes. Arrange about 1 1/2 cups of the breaded chicken
        evenly in basket, with about 1 to 2 inches between each piece. Cook until a thermometer inserted in the thickest
        part of the largest chicken piece registers at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 12 minutes.</p>
